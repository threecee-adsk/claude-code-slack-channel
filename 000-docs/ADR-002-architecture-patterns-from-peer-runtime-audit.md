# ADR-002: Architecture patterns adopted from a peer-runtime audit

## Status

**Accepted** (2026-06-02).

This ADR records architectural patterns CCSC adopts — and anti-patterns CCSC
self-audits against — after a code-level audit of a peer open-source agent
runtime. The patterns drive a hardening backlog (the `ccsc-*` epics filed
alongside this ADR) and a parallel backlog in the companion governance-plane
product (AGP). This ADR is the rationale anchor those beads cite.

## Provenance (brand-neutral)

The source is an 8-auditor code-level read of a peer open-source agent runtime,
followed by an internal council that ratified a contribution strategy. By
deliberate policy, **no peer brand, product, repository, or maintainer name
appears in this repository.** Provenance is cited only as "the peer-runtime
audit," with the full decision record kept privately at
`contributing-clanker/000-docs/013-AT-DECR` (referred to here as **AT-DECR 013**).

Why brand-neutral: the peer relationship is governed by a separate engagement
track that is gated, sequenced, and disclosure-disciplined. Naming the peer in
committed CCSC files would couple our public hardening work to that private
relationship. The *patterns* are general engineering knowledge; the *peer* is
not ours to name here.

## Context

CCSC is a Slack-native governance substrate: every tool call passes a tiered
policy engine; every decision lands in a hash-chained, Ed25519-signed journal.
The peer runtime occupies an adjacent space — a multi-tenant, sandboxed agent
runtime exposed through Slack — but made the opposite set of bets. It is strong
where CCSC is light (durable execution, network-layer credential isolation,
container sandboxing) and light where CCSC is strong (policy gating, signed
audit, human-in-the-loop). Reading its tree surfaced a set of patterns worth
borrowing and a set of footguns worth turning into regression tests.

This ADR does **not** implement any of it. It names the patterns, fixes the
vocabulary, and points at the backlog that does the work.

## The CCSC ↔ AGP relationship (what propagates downstream)

A load-bearing fact for reading the backlog:

- **CCSC is the substrate.** Its kernel — `policy.ts` `gate()`/`evaluate()`,
  `journal.ts`, the Slack relay, `nonce-hitl.ts` — is the governance core.
- **AGP (agent-governance-plane) vendors a pinned copy of that kernel** per AGP's
  ADR 009 (`000-docs/009-AT-ADR-ccsc-substrate-extraction-strategy.md`,
  Option A: vendor a pinned kernel subset for v0). CCSC has **zero** code
  knowledge of AGP — the dependency is one-way, downstream.
- The two systems' Slack/HITL implementations are **independent
  reimplementations**, not shared code: CCSC's is cross-channel admin verbs
  confirmed by an HMAC nonce from a second channel; AGP's is Block-Kit approval
  of policy `require` verdicts. A shared-kernel convergence ("Option D" in ADR
  009) is the documented end-state, trigger-gated on a second consumer.

**Therefore the routing rule for every pattern below:** substrate-level patterns
land in CCSC and propagate to AGP through the vendored copy; governance-plane-only
patterns land in AGP directly. The `ccsc-*` backlog is the substrate work; the
`agp-*` backlog is the plane-only work.

## Borrowable patterns

Brand-neutral names, with the CCSC seam each maps to.

### 1. Credential placeholder-swap

The agent never holds a real secret. Agent-visible state carries a **placeholder**
string; the real credential is swapped in only at the **outbound boundary**, bound
to a specific destination. The blast radius of a prompt injection no longer
includes the live token.

- **CCSC seam:** today the Claude process reads raw `.env` tokens in-process — the
  injection blast radius includes the live Slack tokens. Epic 2 adopts this:
  placeholders in agent-visible state, real values injected at the Slack tool
  boundary, and `assertSendable()` extended to a value-exfiltration guard.

### 2. Lease-fenced durable execution + crash recovery

Every unit of work holds a **fencing lease** (monotonic token + heartbeat) so
exactly one process owns it; a startup **reconciliation sweep** requeues work
whose lease lapsed and reaps orphans. A turn survives a process restart.

- **CCSC seam:** the supervisor's crash recovery is reload-only with no fencing —
  two processes can both believe they own a turn. Epic 1-A adopts a per-turn lease
  + heartbeat, a restart-recovery sweep, and wires lease-loss into the existing
  quarantine path (Epic 32).

### 3. Transactional-outbox reliable delivery

When work goes terminal, a durable **delivery obligation** is recorded in the same
transaction as the terminal marker; a separate leased **poller** consumes the
obligation, retries transient failures, and dead-letters permanent ones. Delivery
is never a fire-and-forget side effect.

- **CCSC seam:** today a failed `chat.postMessage` is logged to stderr and
  swallowed (per `audit-journal-architecture.md` invariant 1, the projection must
  never block tool execution) — a terminal turn can produce no reply, with no
  retry. Epic 1-B adopts a durable obligation, a retrying/dead-lettering leased
  poller, and idempotent sends.

### 4. Per-thread read isolation

Session state is scoped to its thread; one conversation cannot read another's
state by default.

- **CCSC seam:** CCSC already isolates per-thread session files (Epic 32-A). The
  peer **defaulted cross-thread reads ON** — exactly the footgun CCSC avoids. Epic
  3 converts this into a regression test that proves the isolation holds and fails
  loudly if it regresses. (We are already ahead here; the work is the *proof*.)

### 5. Durable workflow checkpoint / event-wait approval

A durable workflow engine can **suspend** at a checkpoint and **resume** on an
external event — a natural place to hang a human-in-the-loop gate without bespoke
infrastructure.

- **CCSC seam:** CCSC's nonce-HITL already provides cross-channel approval; this
  pattern informs the Epic 5 evaluation of where an approval naturally suspends a
  flow, and informs AGP's checkpoint-style approval direction.

### 6. Declaration-as-enforcement

One declaration drives multiple consumers with no drift: in the peer runtime, a
single per-tool secrets table drives the placeholder, the tool context, **and**
the egress firewall rule. One source of truth, three enforcement points.

- **CCSC seam:** Epic 2's secret-declaration schema is the single source for the
  placeholder, the `assertSendable` guard, and (future) host-bound routing — the
  same one-declaration-three-consumers shape.

## Cautionary anti-patterns (we self-audit against these)

The same audit surfaced footguns. Several are defaults CCSC already gets right;
Epic 3 turns each into a regression test so we *stay* right.

| Anti-pattern (observed in the peer) | CCSC posture | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Unenforced network policy** — default-deny silently no-ops when the CNI plugin (e.g. flannel) does not enforce NetworkPolicy, so isolation degrades to default-allow with no signal | N/A in CCSC's process model; relevant to AGP's container sandbox | AGP backlog: preflight-check CNI enforcement before trusting isolation |
| **Cross-thread reads default-ON** | CCSC isolates per-thread by default | Epic 3: regression test proving isolation |
| **No durable tool-call record** — only best-effort stdout logs of argument key-names + byte-sizes; no audit table | CCSC journals every decision (allow/deny/require/approved), hash-chained + signed | Epic 3: regression test asserting no decision path skips the journal — **we are already ahead** |
| **Coarse tool authz** — a single `tools:*` scope grants every method of every tool; no allow/deny/require | CCSC's `evaluate()` is per-tool-call allow/deny/require, tier-aware | No new work — **we are already ahead**; noted so the gap stays visible |
| **Mutable, unsigned audit** — plain JSONB rows, no hash-chain, no signature, no verify command | CCSC's journal is hash-chained, Ed25519-signed, with an offline `--verify-audit-log` | No new work — **we are already ahead** |
| **Fail-open defaults** — egress `domains:["*"]`, broad sandbox perms | CCSC gates fail-closed (unknown sender dropped; parse error fatal at boot) | Epic 3: enumerate CCSC defaults, assert fail-closed direction in tests |

The last two rows are the point of the table: on signed audit and per-tool-call
authorization, CCSC is **ahead** of the peer. The hardening backlog is mostly
about durability and the secret boundary, where the peer is ahead of us.

## The security-doc presentation format we adopt

The peer's security documentation is candid in a shape worth copying:

1. **Threat model first** — name the trust boundaries and the adversary before
   the mitigations.
2. **Mitigations with per-item caveats** — each mitigation states its own limit
   inline, not in a footnote ("this stops X; it does not stop Y").
3. **An explicit "what this does NOT protect against" section** — residual risks
   stated plainly, not buried.

Epic 4 restructures `SECURITY.md` and the README security section into this shape,
drawing the residual-risk section from `000-docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`. The honesty of
"here is what we do not defend" is itself a trust signal. (This pass restructures
*presentation*; it does not change any security claim.)

## The Slack-HITL finding (Epic 5 opportunity)

A specific finding worth its own note: the peer runtime **does not wire HITL to
Slack.** Its Slack edge is a thin, stateless webhook listener, and its
human-in-the-loop primitive was designed but never connected to a channel — there
is no approval gate a human can act on from Slack.

Meanwhile, Slack has shipped a native agentic surface — approval previews, Card /
Alert / Data-Table interactive components, and an Agent Browser. CCSC already has
a working cross-channel nonce-HITL and an audit projection. Epic 5 is an
**evaluation** (not a commitment): spike the native approval-preview against our
nonce-HITL, prototype audit receipts with native components, and decide
adopt / hybridize / keep Block Kit — keeping coherence with AGP, since HITL lives
in both systems.

## Decision

Adopt patterns 1–6 as the rationale basis for the `ccsc-*` hardening backlog
(Epics 1–5) and the `agp-*` plane-only backlog, routed by the substrate/plane
rule above. Adopt the three-part security-doc format for `SECURITY.md` and the
README (Epic 4). Treat the anti-pattern table as a standing self-audit checklist.
Name no peer brand in any committed file.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** a concrete, prioritized hardening backlog grounded in a real
  peer's production tradeoffs; the substrate/plane routing keeps CCSC and AGP from
  diverging; the regression tests lock in the defaults where CCSC is already
  ahead; the security docs get more honest.
- **Negative / cost:** Epics 1 and 2 are real durability and secret-boundary work,
  not documentation; the secret placeholder-swap (Epic 2) adds an injection seam
  at the tool boundary that must itself be tested; the brand-neutrality rule means
  future readers cannot follow provenance without access to the private AT-DECR
  013.
- **Non-goals:** this ADR (and the PR that lands it) creates the backlog, the ADR,
  and the README/SECURITY edits only. It does **not** implement the
  durability/secret-firewall features — those are the beads. Nothing here touches
  the peer's repository; the contribution strategy in AT-DECR 013 is a separate,
  gated track.
